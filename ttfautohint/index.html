        <div id="news">
          <h4>1st January 2018</h4>

          <p>The new year starts with a new ttfautohint release,
            version 1.8.1!  (Version 1.8 was not released due to a
            serious configuration bug found after publicly tagging the
            git repository.)  Its main new feature is a third stem
            width and positioning mode, &lsquo;natural&rsquo;: No
            adjustments to stem widths, discrete blue zone
            positioning.  This is what FreeType uses for its
            &lsquo;light&rsquo; (auto-)hinting mode.</p>

          <p>Another important improvement is the possibility to
            manually override stem widths for the hinting process.
            This is especially useful for extra-bold fonts, where the
            algorithmically derived values are often too large,
            causing the filling of &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; in glyphs like
            &lsquo;e&rsquo; or &lsquo;a&rsquo; at small sizes.</p>

          <p>Finally, ttfautohint gets now installed as a library also
            (if you use the Unix toolchain for building and
            installation).</p>

          <p>The complete list of changes can be found in
            the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.8.1/">release
            notes</a>.</p>

          <h4>26th August 2017</h4>

          <p>This release mainly brings support for a bunch of new
            scripts: Adlam, Avestan, Bamum, Buhid, Unified Canadian
            Syllabics, Carian, Chakma, Coptic, Cypriot, Deseret,
            Glagolitic, Gothic, Kayah Li, Lisu, N'Ko, Ol Chiki, Old
            Turkic, Osage, Osmanya, Saurashtra, Shavian, Sundanese,
            Tai Viet, Tifinagh, Vai – many thanks to Sascha Brawer who
            contributed most of the code!</p>

          <p>Other, minor changes are described in
            the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.7/">release
              notes</a>.</p>

          <h4>27th November 2016</h4>

          <p>The long overdue version 1.6 is finally out!  Its main
            new feature is the support of a reference file from which
            all blue zone values are taken.  Besides that, a large
            bunch of new scripts has been added: Armenian, Cherokee,
            Ethiopic, Georgian, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Kannada,
            Malayalam, Sinhala, and Tamil.</p>

          <p>A more detailed list of changes can be found in
            the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.6/">release

          <h4>24th January 2016</h4>

          <p>I've just released version 1.5, which mainly brings
            support for some new scripts: Khmer, Mynamar, and Bengali
            (and more Indic scripts to come in the next release).
            Information on other changes and bugfixes can be found in
            the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.5/">release
            notes</a>.</p>


          <h4>18th October 2015</h4>

          <p>Due to a serious bug in applying control instructions to
            accent-like glyphs, it was necessary to release version
            1.4.1 (containing no other noteworthy changes).  All users
            should upgrade.


          <h4>5th October 2015</h4>

          <p>Version 1.4 is out!  It now supports hinting for fonts
            providing glyphs for Lao, Thai, and Arabic, among other
            things.  It also fixes an annoying buglet for the
            &lsquo;touch&rsquo; keyword as used in control
            instructions files.</p>

          <p>As usual, you can find more information in
            the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.4/">release
            notes</a>.</p>


          <h4>7th January 2015</h4>

          <p>I've released version 1.3.  Besides support for Telugu,
            there is a new facility for testing parameters of
            ttfautohint in parallel.</p>

          <p>Please read
            the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.3/">release
            notes</a> for more.</p>


          <h4>7th October 2014</h4>

          <p>Since yesterday, version 1.2 is available for download.
            The most important change is a new possibility to
            fine-tune the hinting process at a low level.</p>

          <p>Other improvements are covered
            <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.2/">here</a>
            as usual.</p>


          <h4>7th May 2014</h4>

          <p>Version 1.1 is now available.  The main new feature is
            support for the Devanagari script &ndash; please test!</p>

          <p>In case you need hinting for GDI ClearType, you should
            upgrade to this version, since some bugs related to stem
            width computation were identified and fixed.  As usual,
            the complete list of important changes can be
            found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ttfautohint/1.1/">here</a>.</p>

          <h4>27th March 2014</h4>

          <p>The Windows binary of ttfautohintGUI version 1.00 didn't
            work standalone, as intended.  Please download it again
            (the new <tt>.7z</tt> archive has 26-Mar-2014 as the date
            and a size of 3278316 bytes).</p>

          <h3>Version 1.0 has been released</h3>
          <div class="date">22nd March 2014</div>

          <p>Finally, the long-awaited version 1.0 is here!  Compared
            to the 1.00rc1 release, the memory management has been
            improved to avoid excessive allocation under certain
            circumstances.  Support for symbol fonts has been fixed
            also.</p>

          <p>As mentioned earlier, GDI ClearType hinting is now much
            better.  However, I missed to show comparison images,
            which I now do.  The top and bottom images (showing Ubuntu
            regular processed with ttfautohint) are the output of an
            older and the current version of ttfautohint,
            respectively.</p>

        <!-- ************************************************** -->

        <div id="introduction">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p><a href="mailto:wl@gnu.org">Werner Lemberg</a> is making
            it easy for type designers to create web fonts that look
            great on Windows, with <tt>ttfautohint</tt>.</p>

          <p>Hinting TrueType fonts can be a slow and expensive
            process, and many fonts lack good hinting totally because
            they are converted to TrueType from another font
            format.</p>

          <p><tt>ttfautohint</tt> solves this, by building on
            <a href="http://www.freetype.org">FreeType</a>'s
            auto-hinting system.  It brings the excellent quality of
            FreeType rendering to platforms which don't use FreeType,
            yet require hinting for text to look good &ndash; like
            Microsoft Windows.</p>

          <p>Across Windows rendering environments today,
            <tt>ttfautohint</tt> fonts look best with DirectWrite
            ClearType enabled. This is the default for Windows&nbsp;7
            and newer.  Good visual results are also seen in recent
            MacOS X versions and GNU/Linux systems that do use
            FreeType for rendering.</p>

          <p>The main part of the project is a code
            library, <tt>libttfautohint</tt>, which is described in
            detail in the source code header file
            <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob/HEAD:/lib/ttfautohint.h"><tt>src/ttfautohint.h</tt></a>.
            There are utility programs with both command-line and GUI
            interfaces, <a href="#download">ready to use
            today</a>.</p>

          <p>The goal of the project is to generate a &lsquo;first
            pass&rsquo; of hinting that font developers can refine
            further for ultimate quality.</p>

          <div style="text-align: center;
                      margin-top: 2ex">
            <img src="image/LiberationSerif-Regular-TA-dollar-19px.gif"
                 alt="animated dollar glyph of LiberationSerif-Regular"
                 width="407"
                 height="444">
          </div>

          <p>The animation above shows how the hints created
            by <tt>ttfautohint</tt> get applied to the dollar glyph of
            <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation
              Serif Regular</a> at 19&nbsp;pixels per em, using
            <a href="http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/">FontForge</a>'s
            TrueType hinting bytecode debugger.  (You can view the
            image <a href="image/LiberationSerif-Regular-TA-dollar-19px.gif">directly</a>
            to see it in original size.)</p>
        </div>


        <!-- ************************************************** -->

        <div id="roadmap">
          <h2>Roadmap</h2>

          <p>The project started in 2010
            when <a href="http://understandingfonts.com/">Dave
              Crossland</a> suggested the idea of the program.  Werner was
            able to start development thanks to financial support from the
            <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/">Google Web
            Fonts</a> team.</p>

          <p>He soon produced results that received
            <a href="http://typophile.com/node/83829">some warm
              attention from professional type designers</a>.</p>

          <p>Hinting TrueType fonts is a very time consuming and
            expensive process for type designers.  Producing high
            quality hinting for most glyphs in a font, and allowing
            them to fine-tune the results by hand will simplify the
            lives of all type designers.  This little program is set
            to improve the quality of web typography!</p>

          <p>The <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/ttfautohint.git/blob/HEAD:/TODO"><tt>TODO</tt></a>
            file in the source code repository provides an extensive
            list of things which will be eventually handled in one or
            another way.  Here is a short list of essential items:</p>

          <ul style="list-style: circle">
            <li>
              <p><strong>Improve the way you can fine-tune the
                  results</strong> &ndash; you can already control
                blue zones and stem widths together with delta
                instructions and other details of the hinting
                process, but there are certainly aspects that could
                be improved further.  If you have feedback for this
                feature, please send an e-mail
                to <a href="mailto:wl@gnu.org">Werner
                  Lemberg</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Add hooks for other tools</strong> &ndash; to
                allow smooth integration with various font editors.
                Some of them already support a direct call of
                ttfautohint, but more has to be done, especially for
                fine-tuning blue-zones and the like.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Emit the actions in the high-level hinting
                  command languages</strong> &ndash; those used in other
                tools, such as
                <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/tools/vtt.aspx">Visual
                  TrueType (VTT)</a> or
                <a href="http://www.fontlab.com/">FontLab</a>, instead
                of only emitting final low-level bytecode.  This will
                allow designers to fine tune the results by hand
                &ndash; essential for those tricky glyphs that require
                intelligent decisions by a human</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools/">ttx</a>
            to change the font names so that it is possible to use the

        <!-- ************************************************** -->

        <div id="works">
          <h2 class="section">How It Works</h2>

          <p>A detailed description of the auto-hinter inside FreeType
            can be found
            <a href="../autohinting/hinter.html">here</a>.  Although
            these web pages are in need of an update, the basic
            principles of the auto-hinting process haven't changed.
            There is one exception: The auto-hinter no longer tries to
            provide good hinting for monochrome rasterization.
            Instead, it expects anti-aliasing with 256 gray levels,
            which became standard with Windows&nbsp;98.</p>

          <p>A scholarly paper published in the EuroTeX 2003 proceedings,
            titled
            <a href="http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/tb24-3/lemberg.pdf"><em>Real-Time
                Grid Fitting of Typographic Outlines</em></a>, gives
            further insight into the auto-hinting system's inner
            workings.</p>

          <p>In the above links, one aspect of the auto-hinting
            process is missing: The various steps performed by the
            auto-hinter (called <em>actions</em>) can be described as
            high-level operations, for example &ldquo;aligning a given
            edge to a given blue zone,&rdquo; or &ldquo;linking this
            edge to another one within a given distance.&rdquo;
            The <tt>ttfautohint</tt> library hooks into these actions
            and transforms them into bytecode routines.</p>

          <p>Similar to most TrueType hints, the autohint actions
            depend on the device resolution.
            Consequently, <tt>ttfautohint</tt> walks over a large
            range of ppem values (8&nbsp;to 50&nbsp;ppem by default)
            and collects the actions as sets.  A typical glyph outline
            needs three to four sets (covering the whole range), but
            sometimes more than ten are necessary.</p>

          <p>Intentionally, <tt>ttfautohint</tt> adds hints only along
            the y-axis.
            The <a href="http://www.antigrain.com/research/font_rasterization/">Anti-Grain
            research</a> describes some of the reasons behind this
            decision.  While the article is quite old, the mentioned
            ideas are still valid.</p>

          <p>The <tt>ttfautohint</tt> library contains a copy of
            FreeType's &lsquo;autofit&rsquo; module, reformatted and
            using a different function prefix, and with slight
            extensions for hooks into hinting actions.  It therefore
            inherits the same dual-licensing as FreeType; you can
            choose between the GNU Public License (GPL) Version&nbsp;2
            and the FreeType License (FTL).</p>
